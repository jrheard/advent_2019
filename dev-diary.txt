let's do this!
starting with day 1

alg was pretty straightforward

when i got to part b, i initially tried to use a loop {}
but i was having issues reassigning a var that lived outside of the loop
couldn't figure out the answer by googling
so i switched to recursion which made the problem go away :]

next up, i had this utility function

pub fn parse_ints_from_file(filename: &str) -> Vec<i32> {
    let contents = fs::read_to_string(filename).unwrap();

    contents
        .lines()
        .map(|x| x.parse::<i32>().unwrap())
        .collect()
}

and i wanted to figure out how to make it generic

i ended up trying this out

pub fn parse_ints_from_file<T: FromStr + Debug>(filename: &str) -> Vec<T> {
    let contents = fs::read_to_string(filename).unwrap();
    contents.lines().map(|x| x.parse::<T>().unwrap()).collect()
}

but it gives this error:

error[E0599]: no method named `unwrap` found for enum `std::result::Result<T, <T as std::str::FromStr>::Err>` in the current scope
 --> src/util.rs:8:45
  |
8 |     contents.lines().map(|x| x.parse::<T>().unwrap()).collect()
  |                                             ^^^^^^ method not found in `std::result::Result<T, <T as std::str::FromStr>::Err>`
  |
  = note: the method `unwrap` exists but the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
          `<T as std::str::FromStr>::Err: std::fmt::Debug`

error: aborting due to previous error

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0599`.
error: could not compile `advent_2019`.

which i can't figure out what to make of.

made a rust playground link:
https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=ffeee4b54d862e99387b644c9d03d19b
and sent it to smt asking for advice!

will sent back this:

pub fn parse_ints_from_file_generic<T: FromStr + Debug>(filename: &str) -> Vec<T> where <T as std::str::FromStr>::Err: std::fmt::Debug {
    let contents = fs::read_to_string(filename).unwrap();

    contents
        .lines()
        .map(|x| {
            let parsed = x.parse::<T>();
            parsed.unwrap()
        })
        .collect()
}

which he acknowledges is hideous
